  <h2 style={{color:"lightblue"}}>Introduction</h2>
  <br/>
  <p>Agriculture sector is undoubtedly most important sector of Indian economy as it provides employment to 54.6% of people and food security of India revolves around this sector. Its importance can be gauged by the fact that whenever there is fear of deficit monsoon, whole of the population ranging from farmers, workers, businessmen, policy makers and even foreign investors are caught into nervousness. Because of dependence of disproportionate population on this sector, Indian economy can be still said to be an agrarian economy. However, sector is largely state controlled which resulted in widespread inefficiencies and distortions.</p>

  Inputs of agriculture and subsidies thereon
  </h2>
  <br />
  <p>
  <p>Subsidies on inputs have their root in Green revolution. That time extensive subsidies were given on Hybrid seeds, Fertilizers, pesticides etc. main aim of subsidies are two – one is to keep cost of the food grains at minimum and avoiding food inflation, second is to ensure income security of the farmer. While this policy has helped a lot to secure food sufficiency, yet it has many unintended negative impacts. It results in overuse of inputs as inputs costs doesn’t represent adequate market costs, farmers are unable to respond to market signals. They continue to use skewed mix of inputs as costs are borne by government.</p>

      <h3 style={{color:"orange"}}>Seeds</h3>
    </li>
    <p>
    Many schemes such Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna, Macro Management Agriculture, Integrated Scheme for oilseeds, pulses, oil palm and maize (ISOPOM); Technology missions for cotton, National food security Mission etc. provide for subsidized seeds. Some of them also provide incentives for investment in Seed manufacturing infrastructure and upgradations.

  <p>
  There are three stages in seed production cycle. At first stage Breeder seeds are developed by ‘Indian Council of Agricultural Research’ (ICAR), National Seeds Corporation or state farms corporations. In second stage Foundation Seeds are developed by NSC, SFCs or State seeds corporations and then finally Certified Seeds are produced and distributed to all farmers.
  </p>
  <br />
      <h3 style={{color:"violet"}}>     Hybrid Seeds</h3>
  <p>
  Hybrid seeds are obtained by cross pollination of different varieties of related plants. These seeds were instrumental in green revolution. These seeds combine desirable properties of two related plants.One drawback was that these seeds don’t regenerate seeds of same quality. So every time farmers have to buy new seeds. In case of conventional seeds, farmers could use reproduced seeds by current crop.
  </p>
  <br/>
  
    <h3 style={{color:"violet"}}>Genetically Modified Varieties</h3>
  
  <p>
  These varieties of seeds are developed in laboratories by genetic engineering technologies. In these technologies genes of different species of organisms (like bacteria genes with plants) are integrated to modify DNA to get desired characteristic. Bacteria named bacillus Thuringiensis gives a gene that is incorporated into plant’s DNA and we get Genetically Modified Organisms like BT- corn, BT- cotton, Bt- Brinjal etcwhereas in Europe it is largely banned as of now. In India, it is allowed for commercial production of cotton and for food crops field trials are going on.

    <h3 style={{color:"orange"}}> Fertilizers and Manures</h3>
  </li>
  <p>
  <p>
  Fertilizers are any organic/inorganic, natural/synthetic material used in soil to supplement it with plant nutrients which are essential for plant’s growth.
Fertilizers were another most important part of green revolution. Some points to be noted are –
 In India per hectare Consumption around (around 146 Kg) is far lower than developed countries.
 Indian Soils are deficient in Nitrogen and Phosphorus
Fertilizer can most effectively be used with ample water. So rainfed areas (deprived of irrigation) constitute 70 % of agricultural land and still they use only 20% of national Fertilizers consumption. On other hand Rabi crops are dominantly produced in Irrigated areas, so they consume about 66% of fertilizers while their share of total agri output is 33%
Due to rising prices of fertilizers government is promoting organic farming and organic manure.
India meets its 80 % requirement of Urea (N), while it is heavily dependent on Imports for its potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer requirements.
</p>
<h3 style={{color:"voilet"}}> Fertilizers Vs Manure</h3>
<p>
Fertilizers are made through industrial processes in which composition of nutrients is precise and deliberately fixed. In contrast Manure is derived animal waste such as cattle dung and urine. It enriches the soil generally. Further, presence of manure makes fertilizers even more effective.
</p>
<h3 style={{color:'violet'}}>Macronutrients and Micronutrients</h3>
<p>
Plants or crops needs about 17 essential elements to survive and grow. If any of these elements is deficient, then growth will be stalled or plant will die. Among these elements, N, P, Calcium, Magnesium and Sulfur are required in comparative large quantities and termed as macro nutrients. Other elements such as Boron, Chlorine, Copper, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Zinc and Nickel are needed in smaller quantities hence termed as micronutrients. Macronutrient based fertilizers are dominant and its use enhances capability of plants to extract more micronutrients from soil.
Nitrogen – is responsible for green leafy growth and overall plant health. Its Necessary for Photosynthesis to take place. Deficiency will result in yellow leaves and weak plant.
Phosphorous – Is necessary for root, flower and fruit development.
Potassium – Plant health and vigour. It helps plant to fight diseases and pests. It also gives strong cell walls

<h3 style={{color:"orange"}}>Power and water for agriculture</h3>
</li>
<p>
Farmers get highly subsidized or free electricity for agricultural purposes. Electricity is mainly consumed in pumping out underground water. As 70 % of countries agricultural land is Rainfed electricity becomes main input in agricultural produce.
However subsidized and ample electricity has resulted in indiscriminate use of electricity by the farmers, which results in massive wastage of electricity and water. In fact this is main reason behind depleting ground water. It also provides avenues for pilferage and theft of electricity.
</p>
<h3 style={{color:"violet"}}>Separation of feeders</h3>
<p>
Feeder is an electrical cable or group of electrical conductors that runs power from a ‘larger central source’ to one or more secondary or branch-circuit distribution centers(to end user). We have yet common feeder lines for agricultural and other sectors in all states except Gujrat.
In Gujrat Jyotigram Yojna was initiated in 2006, which separated agricultural feeders from main feeder. Agricultural feeder supply was regulated and power is given only for 8-10 hours per day. Timings of powers are pre declared to the farmers. On the main feeder power is supplied full time. This development has two fold benefits; one is surplus electricity for industry and civilians and second is it arrested rapid depletion of ground water. Result is Gujrat has surplus power of 2000 MW (out of total capacity of 14000 MW) which is sold to other states.
Success of this scheme was recognized by planning commission and it was made central to power reforms under 12th five year plan.
New scheme Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojna, aims for separation of feeders at national level. It is first to be rolled out in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. Scheme would be merged with ‘Integrated Power Development Scheme’, which aims at improving India’s sub-transmission and distribution network.
</p>
<h3 style={{color:"voilet"}} >Irrigation</h3>
<p>
Although India is the second largest irrigated country of the world after China, only one-third of the cropped area is under irrigation. Irrigation is the most important agricultural input in a tropical monsoon country like India where rainfall is uncertain, unreliable and erratic India cannot achieve sustained progress in agriculture unless and until more than half of the cropped area is brought under assured irrigation.
This is testified by the success story of agricultural progress in Punjab Haryana and western part of Uttar Pradesh where over half of the cropped area is under irrigation! Large tracts still await irrigation to boost the agricultural output.
