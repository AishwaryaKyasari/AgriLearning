            <p>Hydroponic farming, which is soil-less, water-based farming operations, may even be done in a tiny space such as a balcony. Instead of employing soil for plant nourishment, crops are supplied nutrient-rich water, which eliminates much of the baggage associated with soil-based approaches.</p>

In other words, it is the farming without soil and growing the <a href="https://www.agrifarming.in/crop-plants-information">crops</a> on water. The word Hydroponics means “Water Related” and this technology of farming has become popular and has greater applications in <a href="https://www.agrifarming.in/modern-farming-methods-techniques">modern farming</a> practices.</p>
            <p><span><strong>Hydroponics Farming Process:- </strong></span>In Hydroponics Farming, water is enriched with well balanced nutrients which are essential for plants growth and  better yield. Water level pH will be maintained within the specific range which results in better growth and produce. In this farming, plants take the nutrients from the water and using sun light, they produce the output. As we said it’s a soilless farming, one should ensure to replace the basic functions of soil while opting for Hydroponics farming. The following are the basic functions of the soil which have to be provided in water based farming in the absence of soil. </p>

                <br/>
                <li>
                    <span><strong>Supply of Oxygen: </strong>In soil based farming, plats use the oxygen from the soil where as in Hydroponics, plants get the oxygen from the water. This is just like providing the oxygen for fish in the tank.</span>

            <p>The hydroponic farming industry solves many of these concerns.</p><p><a href="https://puregreensaz.com/crop-processes/">Hydroponic systems</a> are soil-less, water-based farming processes. Rather than using soil for plant nutrition, crops are fed nutrient-rich water, negating a lot of the baggage that comes with soil-based methods.</p><p>In this article, you’ll learn 10 benefits of hydroponic farming.</p><h2 id="saves-space">Saves Space</h2><p>Plants grown in soil need to spread their roots in order to
                find water and all the nutrients they need to survive. This means they must be planted
                a certain distance apart from each other.</p>
            <p>In hydroponic systems, roots don’t need to spread because
                water and nutrients are delivered right to them.</p><p>As a result, hydroponic systems can <a href="https://puregreensaz.com/greenhouse-yields/">grow more</a> plants in the same amount of space as soil-based systems.</p><h2 id="water-conservation">Water Conservation</h2><p>Did you know field farms account for <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/irrigation-water-use/">80%
                    of the United States’</a> water use?</p><p>Field farming uses so much water because so much of it is lost. Water evaporates, rolls away, and puddles, making much of it unusable. That’s a lot of waste!</p><p>Hydroponic systems use <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/hydroponics.htm">about 10 times</a> less water because it’s delivered in a controlled way. Plus, some systems recirculate water, reducing consumption even more!</p><h2 id="fewer-chemicals">Fewer Chemicals</h2><p>While hydroponic systems don’t eradicate pest issues, it
                        does lower the potential of this happening, resulting in less need for pesticides
                        and herbicides.</p><p>Hydroponic systems are highly controlled so there’s no risk
                            of weeds taking over your garden. As a result, there’s no need for herbicides.</p><p>Plus, because hydroponic systems are often indoors, pests can’t infiltrate them <a href="https://homeguides.sfgate.com/pesticides-hydroponics-33053.html">as easily</a>, so pesticides aren’t necessary.</p><h2 id="faster-growth">Faster Growth</h2><p>Plants grown in hydroponic systems grow <a href="http://www.saferbrand.com/articles/hydroponic-growth-rate">30% to 50% faster</a> than those grown in soil.</p><p>Crops <a href="https://www.powerhousehydroponics.com/why-hydroponic-plants-grow-faster/">grow
                                faster</a> in hydroponic systems because they receive an ideal amount of
                nutrients and, if grown indoors, have less environmentally induced stress (like
                weather and pests).</p><p>Some species are faster than others. For example, leafy greens like lettuce and thirsty fruits like tomatoes tend to grow faster in hydroponic systems.</p><h2 id="nutrient-control">Nutrient Control</h2><p>Hydroponic systems feed plants a nutrient solution mixed
                    with water, giving the farmer better control over what nutrients their crops soak
                    up.</p><p>Cultivar grown in soil may need the help of fertilizers to survive.
                        But in hydroponics, the plants are already receiving all the help they need and
                        the right amount of it.</p><p>Do your research and <a href="https://university.upstartfarmers.com/blog/overview-hydroponic-nutrient-management">make the right measurements</a>, and the crops will have everything they need to survive just from their water.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"> <iframe class="lazyload" title="What Is Hydroponics: Amazing Advantages Over Soil-Based Agriculture" width="1080" height="608" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHpNu4_6uc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></figure>

                        <h2 id="grow-indoors">Grow Indoors</h2><p>Another benefit of hydroponic farming is that it’s easy to do
                            indoors.</p><p><a href="https://puregreensaz.com/indoor-microfarming/">Growing
                                indoors</a> comes with its own benefits such as the ability to grow year-round,
                temperature and climate control, and fewer pests.</p><p>Hydroponic systems are usually implemented indoors because of the environmental control it offers. With near perfect growing conditions, plants grow stronger and faster.</p><h2 id="healthier-plants">Healthier Plants</h2><p>In hydroponic farming, plants grow healthier than in soil.</p><p>For one thing, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-are-soilborne-diseases-1402990">soil-borne
                    diseases</a> aren’t an issue in hydroponics because there is no soil for those
                diseases to fester and spread in.</p><p>Plus, plants don’t have to spread their roots out in search of nutrients so they get to <a href="https://completehydroponics.com/blogs/news/why-do-hydroponic-plants-grow-better">spend more energy</a> on growing.</p><h2 id="bigger-yields">Bigger Yields</h2><p>Because more plants can be grown in small spaces with
                    hydroponic farming than soil farming, hydroponic systems typically <a href="https://puregreensaz.com/greenhouse-yields/">yield more per square foot</a>.</p><p>Additionally, plants are healthier and grow faster, generating more produce faster.</p><p>Indoor conditions also allow for year-round growing, regardless of weather or season, so plants’ that continue to produce after the initial harvest can be harvested more times.</p><h2 id="no-soil-erosion">No Soil Erosion</h2><p>Field agricultural practices have eroded <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/soil-erosion-and-degradation">half
                        of the soil on Earth</a> in the last 150 years, decreasing the availability of
                arable land.</p><p>Hydroponic systems don’t use soil.</p><p>No soil means no soil erosion. It’s that simple.</p><h2 id="no-weeds">No Weeds</h2><p>Hydroponic systems are not habitable for the seeds of weeds.</p><p>Weeds need the same things as other plants to sprout, but seeds <a href="https://www.greenandvibrant.com/seed-starting-hydroponics">aren’t
                    typically sowed</a> in hydroponic systems. That way the system can be tailored
                to the growing phase rather than germination.</p><p>Since the seeds can’t start germinating, <a href="https://homeguides.sfgate.com/advantages-hydroponics-over-soil-47626.html">weeds won’t take root</a> and steal your crops’ precious nutrients.</p><p>Now that you know the benefits of hydroponic farming, it’s
