                <br />
                <p>Inorganic farming is an agriculture production method which involves the use of manmade products such as pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, hormones and other chemical which are used to increase the rate of growth of crops.</p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>Due the awareness and the present day market
                    potentials respondents in the age group less than 35 years
                    were practicing organic farming i.e., 40 per cent and 12 per
                    cent respondents in the age group 46 and above were
                    practicing organic farming and the remaining were in
                    inorganic farming. It has also been found that the practice
                    of inorganic farming increase with the increase in their
                    level of education. Especially respondents who donâ€™t have
                    any formal education practice organic farming</p>

                    Inorganic fertilizers are also sometimes referred to as chemical or synthetic fertilizer because their plant-providing nutrients have been synthesized or manufactured in a laboratory or refinery. Until 100 years ago, fertilizers were all organic because the science and chemistry behind inorganic fertilizers had not been developed. However, since then we have learned plants develop well using inorganic nutrients, and these fertilizers offer gardeners several advantages.

                        <li>
                            <h1 style={{ color: 'green' }}>Fast Acting</h1>
                            <br />
                            <p>One advantage inorganic fertilizers offer is that they are fast acting. These nutrient-rich salts dissolve quickly and are immediately available to the plants depending on them to provide essential nourishment in the form of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. In cases when plants show signs of nutrient deficiency, inorganic fertilizers have a distinct advantage over organic choices, which depend on soil organisms to first break down the organic matter before nutrients can be released. This delay can result in plants not receiving required levels of vital nutrients and causing stunted growth, poor fruit and flower development or weak stems. Inorganic fertilizer's fast delivery of essential elements and minerals eliminates this potential problem.</p>

                            <h1 style={{ color: 'green' }}>Easy of Use</h1>
                            <br />
                            <p>Inorganic fertilizers also offer the advantage of coming in several easy-to-use formulations, which also makes them much easier to transport than organic fertilizers like manure. Inorganic fertilizers are available as dry granules, water-soluble powders and liquid concentrates, as well as spikes and tabular formats designed specifically for indoor or garden container plants. Controlled-release inorganic fertilizers dispense plant nutrients over an extended period from three to eight months, eliminating the need for repeated fertilizer applications throughout the growing season -- an added advantage for busy home gardeners.</p>

                        <br /><br />

                            <h1 style={{ color: 'green' }}>Low Cost</h1>
                            <p>Because inorganic fertilizers are mass produced, they are less costly than organic fertilizers, which carry a significantly higher expense. In particular, dry granular controlled-release inorganic fertilizers are a very cost-efficient option for home gardeners because they provide complete nutrition and do not require repeated applications.</p>
